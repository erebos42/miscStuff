Clean Code Example
==================

This project contains three version of a simple number guessing game (exercise
taken from [1]). The idea of this is to show how important clean code can be. I
don't claim that my code is that clean or well written, but... you get the
gist!?

mockup.py   => First clean version in python as a mockup
clean.c     => Clean version in C
fubar.c     => Ugliest and most unreadable code I ever written
